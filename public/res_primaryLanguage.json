      "description": " I'm Omar Kamal. I have been teaching programming professionally for the better part of 3 years. Teaching and helping my students is truly my passion and driving force. My experience in teaching has been varied in relation to the tech stacks I've taught. I've taught a tradition web development MERN stack with a REST API, and I've also taught a software engineering bootcamp focusing on java and spring boot framework for the backend and React for the front end UI design with MySQL as the DBMS. Currently looking for new positions teaching programming. Available for inquiries through the email provided above. I look forward to being a part of a great team in the near future.",
